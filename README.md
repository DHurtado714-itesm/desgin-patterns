## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like blueprints that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Examples include:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Examples include:
- Adapter
- Composite
- Proxy
- Flyweight
- Facade
- Bridge
- Decorator

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
